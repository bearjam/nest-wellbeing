title: Frequently Asked Questions Baby Massage
main:
  items:
    - question: How old does my baby have to be to come to massage?
      answer: You can start massage at birth but in a class babies cope better over 4 weeks. It does depend on your baby and how much they mind (or don’t mind!) being undressed
    - question: Is there an upper age limit for baby massage?
      answer: Once babies are crawling, they are not suitable for a baby massage class - because they will want to be off exploring!
    - question: What do I bring to a massage class?
      answer: A small towel for your baby to lie on and some plant based oil, plus all of your usual baby needs.
    - question: What oil is suitable for baby massage?
      answer: A plant based oil such as grapeseed, fractionated coconut, Calendula or sunflower. Nut based oils should be avoided i nclass in case of an allergic reation.
    - question: What if my baby cries in class?
      answer: Don’t worry - most babies cry at some point in a class. The class is very relaxed and there are comfortable charis in the room if your baby needs time out. Other parents are also very understanding.
    - question: What if my baby needs feeding and/or changing during a class?
      answer: You can feed and change your baby in the same room as the massage.
    - question: How much are the classes?
      answer: 4 sessions are currently £36 and last an hour. 4 sessions are an ideal amount to learn and practice baby massage basics. Some people sign up for another set with a discount - 8 sessions for £65 so you can take longer to enjoy your classes.
    - question: What if I can't make a class?
      answer: If your baby is unwell or has had vaccinations in the 24 hours before a class and you can’t attend, it is possible to make up a session at a later date. Baby massage is very popular and places are limited to 8 for everyone’s comfort, so it is usually possible to make up a session but not guaranteed.
